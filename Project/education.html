        <h3 class="heading1">Curriculum and Affiliation</h3>
        <p>
            The designing of school curricula requires a conceptual foresight and imagination. Exhaustive evaluation and improvements are made year after year to keep the curriculum dynamic. All-out efforts are made to devise the most effective method for the implementation of the requirements of the curriculum. While selecting the Textbooks and designing Supplementary Reading Material, we generally keep in mind the “Students Learning Outcome” given in the Single National Curriculum (SNC) 2020. The Schools are affiliated with the respective: Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education. The curriculum for different classes is discussed below.

        <h3 class="heading2">Playgroup to Class Prep</h3>
        <p>
            The first educational step that a child takes at an impressionable age of three is in Playgroup and then on to Nursery. Bearing in mind that the foundation of a child’s personality is laid and two-thirds of his/her intellect develops at this age, we have created an environment and system of teaching which is entirely child-friendly. The students of these classes are housed in a separate block with their own work area, play-area and well-equipped activity room.

            Steps are taken to achieve Holistic Development of students through the implementation of Early Childhood Care and Education Curriculum. Development is simultaneous and integrated and has been grouped into the following key learning areas:

    <section class="content">
        <h3 class="heading2">Class 1 to 5</h3>
        <p>
            The basic concepts that a child was introduced to, in the Preschool, take a more firm footing here and the syllabus becomes more broad-based. The young learner is gradually exposed to subjects like Urdu, English, Mathematics, General Knowledge, Science and Social Studies besides the teaching of Islamiyat & Nazra Quran. Efforts are made to make the teaching more communicative and interactive to encourage students’ participation.

            The Teaching Faculty comprises 1265 professionally qualified, experienced and devoted teachers. The majority of the teachers possess Master’s Degree in their respective disciplines. Some of the teachers have MPhil degrees as well. Professional training, experience in teaching, mental alertness, self-confidence, commitment, general bearing and traits of a balanced personality are given due weight while recruiting the staff. Even for Nursery classes the same criterion is observed and Montessori trained teachers have been employed keeping in view the mental level and the age groups of the students.

            A large mosque has been built in the Township Campus where all members of the staff and the senior boys of the Boys High School offer their Zuhr prayer in congregation. The facility for offering Zuhr prayer is also ensured in other campuses where specific places have been reserved and maintained for this purpose.

This facility is offered to students of other campuses as well. The students after passing Class IV can opt for this stream. Preference is given to those students who secure at least 75% marks in the annual examination of Class IV with at least 90% marks in Quran as a subject. The duration of this programme is 3 years. After the completion of the Hifz, the students join the regular stream in Class VII. So far 574 students have completed the Hifz, and presently, 62 students are passing through the Hifz process.
